SPB Thermoelectric Optimizer - GUI to determine optimized carrier concentrations

With this GUI the optimize carrier concentration can be computed using a single parabolic band approach. Because the charge carrier transport can be limited by multiple scattering mechanisms, the controller can choose the scattering mechanism (i.e., acoustic deformation potential, polar optical phonon, and ionized impurity scattering).
